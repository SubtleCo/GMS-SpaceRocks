# GMS-SpaceRocks

Welcome to SpaceRocks!

This is my first foray into the world of video game development.

This clone of an arcade classic features rudementary enemy AI, power-ups, background parallax, camera shake, and pretty much anything else over the top that I could think to cram into one little 500px x 500px window.

Made with GML in Game Maker Studio 2, with a .dmg for MacOS
